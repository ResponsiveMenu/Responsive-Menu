== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. Why do I get the error `Parse error: syntax error, unexpected '[' in /home/..../wp-content/plugins/responsive-menu/src/app/Routing/WpRouting.php on line 19`?

This is due to your PHP version not being high enough, you need at least PHP 5.4 for the plugin to work.

2. I am getting a message similar to `Fatal error: Uncaught exception 'Exception' with message 'parse error: failed at $hamburger-layer-color: ;`, why?

All you need to do is login to your WordPress admin, go to my plugin page and hit 'Update Options' to fix this.
